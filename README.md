A set of tests that was done as a final project for the Automated Testing course at 4 Mayo. The project contains API testing with Pactum.js for https://practice.expandtesting.com/ an UI testing for https://automationteststore.com/ done with Cypress.

To run the tests use the following commands:
1. For API tests: npm run executeTests
2. For UI tests: npm run testCypress (note the tests will run in headless mode).
